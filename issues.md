# Known Issues

The following are some issues you might encounter when running `vagrant` and `virtualbox` on macOS, especially Ventura (13.0).

## Failed to create the host-only adapter

```

### Solution

If you are using macOS Ventura, the OS will not load the `kexts` (kernel extensions) used by `VirtualBox 6.1.40` and earlier. Upgrade to `VirtualBox 7.0.2` (or later) on Ventura.

For earlier macOS versions, try the following.
```
sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv;
sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt;
sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp;
sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB;
```

If running the above does not work, try disabling macOS's System Integration Protection (SIP) as follows.
```
ยง csrutil status
System Integrity Protection status: enabled.
```
